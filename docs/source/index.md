# Welcome to climetlab cems flood's documentation!

The easy way to access GloFAS and EFAS data.

The `climetlab cems flood` package is a plugin of the [CliMetLab](https://climetlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python package, to retrieve [Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)](https://www.globalfloods.eu/general-information/about-glofas/) data from the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) distributed storage system.


```{note} EFAS is currently not available, the plan it to add it in the near future.
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install climetlab-cems-flood
